 The Word was with God in the beginning.  All things were created by him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.  In him was life, and the life was the light of mankind. 5 And the light shines on in the darkness, but the darkness has not mastered it.
 A man came, sent from God, whose name was <a href=\"#2\">John</a>.  He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that everyone might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify about the light. 9 The true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was created by him, but the world did not recognize him.
